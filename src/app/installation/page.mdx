# Installation

System Requirements:

- Node.js 20.10.0
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux.

This guide will get you all set up and ready to use the Next.js Enterprise. We'll cover how to get started using one of our API clients and how to make your first API request. We'll also look at where to go next to find all the information you need to take full advantage of our powerful REST API. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## üéØ Getting Started

Jumpstart your development with the Next.js Enterprise Boilerplate by following these simple steps:

### 1. Fork & clone repository:

Begin by starring and forking the repository on GitLab to your account. Then, clone it locally using:

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/<your_username>/nextjs-enterprise-boilerplate.git
```

<Note>_Don‚Äôt forget to ‚≠ê star the project for easy access!_</Note>

### 2. Install the dependencies:

Navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies. Use `npm ci` to install versions locked in `package-lock.json`, ensuring consistent builds across environments.

```bash
cd nextjs-enterprise-boilerplate
npm ci
```

<Note>
  The `npm ci` command provides faster, more reliable installations for CI/CD
  pipelines by installing directly from `package-lock.json` and skipping certain
  user-oriented features.
</Note>

### 3. Start the Development Server

Kick off the development server to see your project in action:

```bash
npm run dev
```

<Note>
  View your application by opening http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
</Note>

### 4. Enforcing Conventional Commits with Git Hooks:

This project adheres to the Conventional Commits specification to ensure a consistent commit message format, which facilitates semantic versioning and changelog generation. We use Git hooks, managed by the pre-commit tool, to automate the enforcement of this specification.

#### ** Automated Setup with Husky**

We leverage Husky to manage our Git hooks, automating the enforcement of Conventional Commits without requiring manual setup from contributors. Upon cloning the repository and installing dependencies, Husky automatically sets up the necessary hooks, including those for validating commit messages.

```bash
npm install
```

This command triggers the prepare script, seamlessly setting up Husky and the associated Git hooks in your local repository.

<Note>
  The automated setup through Husky ensures that all contributors adhere to our
  commit message conventions, promoting consistency across the project's commit
  history. This one-time setup process is automatically handled for you, making
  it effortless to start contributing to the project.
