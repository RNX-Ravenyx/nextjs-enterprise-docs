# Next.js Enterprise Project Structure

This page provides an overview of the project structure of the Next.js Enterprise application, outlining the organization of top-level folders and files, app routing mechanisms, and how nested and dynamic routes are structured.

Following the introduction, you will find detailed sections explaining each part of the project structure, categorized for easy navigation.

## Top-level Folders

The project's top-level folders are designed to organize the application's core functionalities, components, and configurations systematically.

<ProjectStructureTable type="folders" />

## Top-level Files

Essential configuration files and scripts that dictate the behavior of the Next.js application, TypeScript setup, styling, and other project-wide settings.

<ProjectStructureTable type="files" />

## App Routing

Next.js leverages a file-based routing system, enhanced in this project to support complex routing needs, including nested and dynamic routes.

## Nested Routes

Exploration of how nested routes are implemented within the Next.js framework to create a structured and intuitive application architecture.

## Dynamic Routes

Understanding the setup for dynamic routes, allowing for flexible navigation patterns based on user-generated content or database entries.
